# Electron App for Object Detection

## Current build and run process

Clone the directory and cd into it.
Run `npm install -g electron` to get the required electron version on your system (the node_modules are already included, if for some reason you need to delete these, run npm install to download the node modules from the `package-lock.json` file)
Run `electron .` and the app should open.
